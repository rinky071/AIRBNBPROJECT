Employee Management Sysytem
#Employee Management System - Overview

The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee records efficiently. It provides an intuitive interface for adding, updating, deleting, and viewing employee details. The system is built using Spring Boot (Java 11) for the backend and React.js for the frontend, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Technologies Uses

1. Backend (Spring Boot - Java 11)
Developed using Spring Boot, which simplifies backend development and provides built-in support for REST APIs.
Uses Spring Data JPA for database interaction, ensuring seamless CRUD operations on employee records.
Spring Security (optional) can be used for authentication and role-based access control.
The backend exposes RESTful APIs for frontend communication.

**2. Frontend (React.js)**
Developed using React.js to create a responsive and dynamic user interface.
Utilizes React Hooks and Component-based architecture for efficient state management.
Axios is used for making HTTP requests to interact with the backend.
Provides an intuitive UI to manage employees, including add, edit, delete, and view options.

**3. Database (MySQL)**
The application stores employee data in a relational database.
Uses Spring Data JPA with Hibernate for ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
Supports efficient querying and transactions.

**4.API Integration**
The frontend interacts with the backend using REST APIs.
The backend handles requests, processes data, and returns responses in JSON format.
